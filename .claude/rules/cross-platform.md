## Cross-Platform Awareness (this repo)

This repo is explicitly cross-platform — it provides tooling for both machines.

When writing scripts or paths **in this repo**:
- Provide both `.ps1` and `.sh` variants for setup/utility scripts
- Use forward slashes in paths when possible (works on both platforms)
- Repos live under `~/repos/` (macOS) / `C:\repos\` (Windows); some legacy projects still on Google Drive
- Use `$HOME` or `~` for user directory references, not hardcoded paths

Note: The dual-script rule is specific to this repo. Most projects are platform-specific and don't need both variants.
